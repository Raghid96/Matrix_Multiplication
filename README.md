# Matrix_Multiplication


This program shows the implementation of the matrix multiplication algorithm, using pthread and openMP. 

# Run

To run $ ./matrix_mul_, and change the size of the matrix in the code (matrix_mul_openMP, matrix_mul_pthread, and matrix_mul_seq).

# Output

The run time of each one of the algorithms
